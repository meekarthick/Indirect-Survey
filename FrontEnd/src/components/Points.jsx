      <div className='listdiv'>
        <ol>
          <li><span>Engineering Knowledge:</span> Apply the knowledge of mathematics, science, engineering
            fundamentals, and an engineering specialization to the solution of complex
            engineering problems.</li>
          <li><span>Problem Analysis:</span> Identify, formulate, review research literature, and
            analyse complex engineering problems reaching substantiated conclusions using first
            principles of mathematics, natural sciences, and engineering sciences.</li>
          <li><span>Design/ Development of Solutions:</span> Design solutions for complex engineering
            problems and design system components or processes that meet the specified
            needs with appropriate consideration for the public health and safety, and the cultural,
            societal, and environmental considerations</li>
          <li><span>Conduct Investigations of Complex Problems: </span>Use research-based knowledge and
            research methods including design of experiments, analysis and interpretation of data,
            and synthesis of the information to provide valid conclusions.</li>
          <li><span>Modern Tool Usage:</span> Create, select, and apply appropriate techniques, resources, and
            modern engineering and IT tools including prediction and modelling to complex
            engineering activities with an understanding of the limitations.</li>
          <li><span>The Engineer and Society:</span> Apply reasoning informed by the contextual
            knowledge to assess societal, health, safety, legal and cultural issues and the
            consequent responsibilities relevant to the professional engineering practice.</li>
          <li><span>Environment and Sustainability:</span> Understand the impact of the professional
            engineering solutions in societal and environmental contexts, and demonstrate
            the knowledge of, and need for sustainable development</li>
          <li><span>Ethics:</span> Apply ethical principles and commit to professional ethics and responsibilities
            and norms of the engineering practice.</li>
          <li><span>Individual and Team Work:</span> Function effectively as an individual, and as a member or leader in diverse teams, and in multidisciplinary settings.</li>
          <li><span>Communication:</span> Communicate effectively on complex engineering activities with the
            engineering community and with society at large, such as, being able to comprehend
            and write effective reports and design documentation, make effective presentations,
            and give and receive clear instructions.</li>
          <li><span>Project Management and Finance:</span> Demonstrate knowledge and
            understanding of the engineering and management principles and apply these to
            oneâ€™s own work, as a member and leader in a team, to manage projects and in
            multidisciplinary environments</li>
          <li><span>Life-long Learning:</span> Recognize the need for, and have the preparation and
            ability to engage in independent and life-long learning in the broadest context of
            technological change.</li>
